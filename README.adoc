The following resources were used or referenced during the creation of this program.

Yodogawa-Janken is created using go-nostr (link:https://github.com/nbd-wtf/go-nostr[nbd-wtf/go-nostr： Nostr library for Golang]) library. go-nostr is provided under the MIT license.

The implementation of the relay functionality was inspired by Mr. matsuu's namazu (link:https://github.com/matsuu/namazu[matsuu/namazu： 緊急地震速報（予報）を受け取ってSNSに投げるプログラム一式]), which is provided under the MIT license.

Most of the processing in the ``postReply`` function in ``main.go`` mimics Mr. mattn's makeitquote (link:https://github.com/mattn/nostr-makeitquote[mattn/nostr-makeitquote]). makeitquote is available under the MIT license.

I would like to express my gratitude here as Yodogawa-Janken could not have been created without these programs.
